# Wedding-Data-Analysis-

Wedding Cost Analysis Project
This project involved a comprehensive wedding cost analysis using SQL for data preparation and Python for dynamic cost breakdowns. The goal was to create an itemized price list for each vendor, tailored to the client's budget and guest count, and present the results in a structured proposal format.
